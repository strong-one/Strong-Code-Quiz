Coding Quiz

The goal is to create a coding quiz, where user is greeted with a start screen displaying a button and descriptive paragraph explaining the rules, a high score link and a time starting at 120 seconds. Once the user clicks the start button, a new screen comes up with a question and a set of answers to choose from, the timer will then countdown. If the user clicks the wrong answer, they are shown it was wrong and the time decreases by 10 seconds. When the correct answer is chosen, the user will then see a new screen with a question and a set of answers, this process will repeat over a series of 4 questions.

This assignment is proving to be very challenging the more I create. I am having to research and test different strageties to accomplish the end result. Ultimately it is showing me the importance of being able to truly understand javascript to its core.
